# Scala Implicit Conversion Error

This example demonstrates a common issue in Scala related to implicit conversions. The `MyClass` utilizes an implicit conversion in its `myMethod` to handle different types, but it fails if an appropriate implicit isn't defined for a specific type (Double in this case).  The solution showcases how to properly handle such situations.
